What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? 
That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code, 
and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?

I want to know if the code is readable first and foremost. Anything
that helps me to have more readable code or helps the person I'm
reviewing have easier to read code is good feedback.

I also find that sometimes the first way I solve a problem 
sometimes causes for confusing logic, and if someone can help me
make the logic with fewer double negatives or things like that that is
also welcome for me.




We have an awful lot of computers here, 
and it gets pretty confusing with slightly different things 
running on all of them. 
How could containers help us improve this situation? 

Containers are a way for computers, even a bunch of computers
running with different operatoring systems, to run the same programs
and get the same results using those programs.
